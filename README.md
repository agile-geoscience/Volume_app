Subsurface volumetrics and risking

This is an MIT AppInventor project. It consists of a
pair of apps: Volume and Risk. You can open the ZIP
files in AppInventor; just upload them there. 

You can upload the APK file to your phone, or unpack it
with Google Android tools. In order to run it on your
phone you will need to allow installation of non-market
apps in Settings > Security. 

This app is available in the Android Market, aka Google
Play. You can install it from there if you prefer. Its
name is Volume* and the helper app is Risk*.
